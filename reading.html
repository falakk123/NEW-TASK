       <p> The Chocolate Factory
We visited a chocolate factory today as part of educational activity.</p><p> School children were very excited to see how chocolates are made and to learn about the different types of machinery used in the process. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. We even got to taste some of the chocolate at the end of the tour! It was a great learning experience for everyone involved.

The first stop on the tour is usually the huge room where the cocoa beans are roasted. </p>The beans are roasted in huge drums and then cooled before they are ground into a fine powder. Then the powder is mixed with milk and sugar to make a thick paste. This paste is called chocolate liquor.
